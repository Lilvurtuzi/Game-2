# ðŸŽ® Rational Function Rumble

A vibrant, gamified educational app for teaching precalculus students to graph rational functions through timed challenges and leaderboards.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: 30-second timed challenges with real-time feedback
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard modes with progressively complex functions
- **Visual Learning**: Interactive graphs with highlighted features (asymptotes, holes, intercepts)
- **Gamification**: Scoring system, leaderboards, and progress tracking
- **Neon Gaming Aesthetic**: Vibrant colors, animations, and visual effects
- **Audio Feedback**: Background music and sound effects (browser-dependent)

## Mathematical Concepts Covered

- X-intercepts and Y-intercepts
- Vertical asymptotes
- Holes (removable discontinuities)
- End behavior analysis
- Rational function graphing

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rational-function-rumble.git
cd rational-function-rumble
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

1. Enter your name in the sidebar
2. Select a difficulty level
3. Click "Start New Challenge" to begin
4. Analyze the displayed rational function
5. Enter your answers for:
   - X-intercepts (comma-separated)
   - Y-intercept
   - Vertical asymptotes (comma-separated)
   - Holes (x,y coordinates if present)
6. Submit before the 30-second timer runs out
7. View your score and detailed feedback
8. Save your score to the leaderboard
